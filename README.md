# Pre-loved - West London

This is the link to my project on [Heroku](https://preloved-westlondon.herokuapp.com/)
This is my final project (4/4) for General Assembly's Web Developer Immersive course.
A MERN stack application

## Project brief:

* Use Mongo, Express and Node to build an API and a React front-end app that consumes it
* Create an API using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* Include all major CRUD functions in a RESTful API for at least one of those model
* API must include tests for the authentication and restful routes
* Consume your own API by making your front-end app with React
* Add authentication to your API to restrict access to appropriate users
* Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS
* Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible
* A working API hosted somewhere on the internet
* A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
* A readme.md file
