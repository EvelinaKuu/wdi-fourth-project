This is my final project (4/4) for General Assembly's Web Developer Immersive course.
A MERN stack application

Project brief:

***Use Mongo, Express and Node to build an API and a React front-end app that consumes it
***Create an API using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
***Include all major CRUD functions in a RESTful API for at least one of those model
***API must include tests for the authentication and restful routes
***Consume your own API by making your front-end app with React
***Add authentication to your API to restrict access to appropriate users
***Layout and style your front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS
***Deploy your application online so it's publically accessible
***A working API hosted somewhere on the internet
***A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
***A readme.md file
